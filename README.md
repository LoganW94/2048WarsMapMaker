# 2048WarsMapMaker
A GUI to make maps for 2048Wars

Uses JSON to store map data

python 3.5 and pygame needed to run this app

## Mapping guidelines
Maps should be kept under 20 tiles long. Maps larger than 20 tiles are too large to fit on a screen.

Rocks (which spawn barbarians) should be placed sparingly. Rocks close together will cause many barbarian cities to form. 4 or so rocks spread across the map is generally safe.

Water and trees do the same thing. The only difference is aesthetics.

On larger maps (15+) consider adding multiple cities per player.

Not all maps have to be 4 player.

Make sure that starting positions are easily defended.
